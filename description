🚀 AutoInvoice Engine – n8n Automation Workflow
📌 Project Overview

AutoInvoice Engine is a fully automated invoice processing system built using n8n automation platform and OpenAI AI models.
This workflow eliminates manual data entry by automatically extracting structured information from invoices (PDFs and Images) and storing it in Excel with duplicate validation.

The system is designed for businesses that receive daily invoices and need an intelligent, automated way to process them.
